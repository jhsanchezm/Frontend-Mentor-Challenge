## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I putted in practice the :hover state, in this case was a bit difficult for me to put two elements to act at the same time in the hover state. The error is that i was putting them as siblings in the HTML.

And putted in practice the position in CSS and the opacity as a tool to hide elements.

And learned to use tools like PureRef to calculate the size based on the picture that was given to me.


### Continued development

I'm not still confortable with the animations and transitions in CSS, so I need to put much more practice on this.

### Useful resources

- [tsbsankara - YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bGbykdR4T8&t=1557s) - This video helped me with the problem that I had with the hover over the main-image.
- [MRZ.Code.Manufacture - YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neuRRdAqlVY) - This video helped me using the PureRef tool that supported me to measure the size of the elements depending on the screen size.
