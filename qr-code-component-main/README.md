## My process

- Step 1: Organizing the index.html file, like adding the container of the card, and then adding the image.

- Step 2: Creating the style.css document, passing the properties from the HTML tag <style> to our style.css

- Step 3: adding the general things to our style.css, like the typogrphy and the colors to every tag

- Step 4: Then added Flexbox to put out layout in order.

At the moment the hardest part of the process for me is not the coding, but instead working with Github, making the deployment and doing this documentation. I've spent more time with this than coding.



### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox



### What I learned

At the moment I have not many struggles at coding this and I enjoyed. The thing that I liked most were the alternative solutions to the tutorial that I did on my CSS

```css
body {
	heigh: 90vh;
	margin: 20px
}
```


### Continued development

I will put in practice what I've learned in Udemy courses and I see the Challenges in Frontend Mentor are very good way to put in practice and remmember what I've seen before.

And to give myself the good practice of documentate every step in this journey.

### Useful resources

- [tsbsankara - YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFyMWwOxHYM) - This helpme with the calc(100vh - 1px) but I saw better to put height: 90vh. And helped me with the deployment, but I did it with Github Pages.
- [Mr Coder - YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BBYPntB-GY&t=548s) - This is another way to do the same challenge.
- [Fazt - YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaxgF4v4hms) - This helped me how to do the deployment to Github pages [Spanish].
- [mesutcifci - Github](https://github.com/mesutcifci/Frontend-Mentor-Challenges) - This helped me how to make the documentation and orginize the repository.
