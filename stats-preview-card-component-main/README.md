## My process

First I worked in the general things of the card specially the text. Next to this I had to work with the image and all his components and at the end I used the @media to change the layout component when the screen size changes.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

To put a layer over an image with the pink element


### Continued development

I expect to advance in the next Frontend Mentor challenge
