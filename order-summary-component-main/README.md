## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Background-images in the body


### What I learned

The main thing that I've learned with this challenges are the background-image options in the body.


```css
body {
  background-image: url("./images/pattern-background-mobile.svg");
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-size: 100%;
  background-color: var(--pale-blue);
  background-position: top;
}
```

### Continued development

Just need to put in practice more challenges to be sure from repetition of CSS properties.

### Useful resources

- [MRZ.Code.Manufacture - YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpOxFTRhXE0) - This video helped me using the PureRef tool that supported me to measure the size of the elements depending on the screen size.
